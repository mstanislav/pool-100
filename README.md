Pool 100
========
Pool 100 is a multiplayer score-tracking iOS application which provides an easy way to enjoy the game "100" without having to involve pen/paper or a whiteboard/marker to track.

Instructions
------------
"100" is a pool game that's great for a group of people to play together as individuals or on teams. The rules (at least, the rules I play) are as followed:

Each player (or team-player) gets a chance to pocket as many balls as possible. Each pocket is worth a specific value and for each pocketed-ball, the player receives that many points. If a player scratches or pockets a ball accidentally ("slop") they lose 5 points. If a player pockets a ball but also scratches/slops another ball, they get the value minus 5 points. To win the game, you must score *exactly* 100 points. If you go over 100 points, your score wraps past 100 back to 0 (plus whatever you were 'over'). For example, if you had 95 points and scored a 15-point pocket, your new score is 10. "Slop" does not apply when your score wraps, so you don't subtract any points in that case. As-needed, re-rack the balls and the current player gets to break.

Feel free to modify the rules or read someone else's rules online (also sometimes played as "101"). In general, the scoring app should be reasonably apt to adapt to varied rules.
